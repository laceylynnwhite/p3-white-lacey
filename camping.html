            <p>So at 26 I finally went on my very first camping trip. Like, ever. I wasn't sure what to expect. I've been to Disney World where they have a campground but I'm pretty sure we stayed in a cabin so that doesn't count. Not this time. We went in the woods, sleep in a tent camping. We went to <a href="https://www.reserveamerica.com/explore/river-junction-campground-withlacoochee-state-forest/FLFS/1120179/overview" target="_blank">River Junction Campground</a> There wasn't a ton to do there, but I do recommend it if you're looking for somewhere close in Central Florida.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When we arrived we all started setting up tents. We came with a massive tent that took us almost an hour to set up. I may or may not have watched most of the time. My aunt did hook me up with a blow-up mattress that had a headboard, but let's pretend it wasn't that fancy. (It was very nice) I went with my best friends and we had a blast! We camped out for two nights and I'm not going to lie, it was extremely cold one night. Like frigid, I think I'm going to die kind of cold. But it was all for the experience right?</p>
            <br>
            <p>One morning I woke up and made sausage gravy and biscuits for everyone. They were homemade too! We grilled burgers, brats, and had all the fixings. We sat around the fire both nights; talking, drinking and just having a great time. We did have a scare one night. We heard scratching outside of our tents and we all freaked out. My best friend called me on my cellphone from her tent and we all peeked out to see what it was. We couldn't tell for a while. So finally, a brave soul got out of their tent (sure wasn't me) and checked out what was happening. Come to find out, a bunch of racoons were trying to steal our stuff! They dug through our garbage and one even ate my protein cookie! So, pro-tip, don't leave your trash out when you go camping.</p>
