            <h2>Hey there, I'm Lacey!</h2>
            <p>Thanks so much for stopping by. I'm a twenty-something year old graduate student at the University of Florida. I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in Mass Communications with a specialization in digital strategy. I earned my bachelor's degree in Business Management from the University of South Florida back in 2017. When I'm away from school I miss it so I guess that's why I keep going back. I also work full-time on the social media team for a southeastern grocery retailer, so I tend to stay pretty busy.
            <br>
            <br>
            I currently live in Lakeland, Florida and am in the process of purchasing my first house. Woo! (Stay tuned for updates on that!) I have lived in Florida my whole life, but I love to explore new places. In my free-time, I love to kick back and play video games with friends or just hangout with my two dogs, Auggie and Luna. Traveling is one of my favorite things, so you could say I'm pretty excited for the world to hopefully go back to as much normal as we can after a pandemic.</p>

            <p>So why are you here? My goal here is really just to have fun and share my journey with you guys. I love trying new things, wandering, taking pictures. You know the gist. I hope to see this page evolve into something worth revisiting and hopefully provide you something worthwile. This is really just a site about me. I'm not that interesting, but maybe I can show you some interesting things! Thanks for stopping by and if you want to stay in touch, just <span class="standout">click the button</span> below.</p>
