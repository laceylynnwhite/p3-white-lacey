        <h1>5 Best Taco Places in Lakeland, FL.</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="husky-top">
            <p>Now before I get started, don't come at me about how bad my choices are. You're dealing with a girl who used to only eat at Taco Bell because I didn't know the wonders of a real taco. But you're welcome to <a href="contact.html">message me</a> more suggestions because I've fallen in love with a good taco on a corn tortilla. Check out some of my favorites that are local to Lakeland.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Tacos My Friend.</h2>
            <p>This is the BEST taco stand I have been to so far. Now granted, I haven't been to many. But this one takes the cake. I'm very boring and not a fan of raw onions or cilantro, so a perfect taco for me is chorizo, steak, or chicken and cheese and a sauce. Simple is better for me. Tacos My Friend has a red sauce that we absolutely love. It's just spicy enough, but not too overwhelming. I also recently tried the torta with chorizo and oh my. You're welcome.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>La Michoacana.</h2>
            <p>La Michoacana is apparently called "La Calentana" now, but I still kept the old name because many people know it as that and that's what we still call it. This little taco stand is on Memorial Blvd. and seems a little sketch at first, but it's really good. I love the carne asada and pork here. I always ask for the "green sauce" because their red sauce is too spicy and not a flavor I'm a fan of.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Taco Bus.</h2>
            <p>Don't hate. Taco Bus has barbacoa that is to die for. It's the only thing I get here and I just get corn tortilla tacos with cheese. This was one of the first tacos I got when I strayed away from Taco Bell. Your girl has evolved. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Fuzzy's Taco Shop.</h2>
            <p>This isn't your street taco, but it's still worth mentioning. Fuzzy's has good-quality tacos, quesadillas, and burritos if you're looking for a more mainstream taco option. They also have frozen margaritas and chips & guac for the perfect hagnout with friends. They have outdoor seating so you can bring your fur friends too!</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Gallito.</h2>
            <p>This place is only last on my list because they're a little pricey for your average taco. But they're still good! Gallito is located at the Joinery in downtown Lakeland and it's a very cute, highly instagrammable place. I recommend giving them a try. I had one when they first opened and it had pork belly and pineapple in it. They also have pork carnitas, carne asada, and chicken. </p>
