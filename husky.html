        <h1>Parenting 101: A Guide to Raising Siberian Huskies</h1>

        <div class="husky-top">
            <p>So you think you want a Siberian Husky? My first recommendation: do your research. I'm going to share a few tips and suggestions here. But please do your research before just getting one because they "look cool." Trust me. I always wanted a husky because of how cool they looked and who didn't love the movie Balto growing up? Now I have two huskies that look like Steele and Jenna, but life isn't a kids movie ya know? My two huskies are both six years old and I love them to death but they sure are a handful. But I wouldn't change it for the world. So check out some tips and insight I have to offer below before you consider getting a Siberian Husky.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Invest in a good brush.</h2>
            <p>A quality brush is essential for keeping your husky well-groomed and your house from being overrun with hair. I'm guilty of not brushing my dogs as much as I should. I know I know. Mine are both inside dogs; however, being in hotter climate makes their undercoat shed even more than normal. Siberian Huskies generally shed their coat twice a year and especially around summertime. So make sure you're ready for hours, yes, hours of brushing. You can find good quality deshedding brushes at places like PetSmart if you want to drop a pretty penny  or you can just check out some of the similar options <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?i=aps&k=deshedding%20brush&ref=nb_sb_noss_1&url=search-alias%3Daps" target="_blank">Amazon</a> has to offer.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Invest in a good vacuum.</h2>
            <p>I cannot put into words how much I love my <a href="https://direct.sharkclean.com/16/products/shark-vertex-powered-lift-away-az2000w/20/microsite/ogiii/?opt=2" target="_blank">Shark Apex</a> vacuum. No, this isn't sponsored. Don't like dog hair? Do not get a husky. But if you're willing to take the time to upkeep all the hair and have carpet you're worried about getting hair out of, just invest in a high-quality vacuum cleaner. I'm not usually one to say spend a ton of money on something, but it's worth it when we're talking about something you're going to be using very often. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>The park will be your best friend.</h2>
            <p>I wish I would've gotten my huskies adjusted to going to the dog park much, much sooner. I was always afraid because huskies are escape artists and I was scared they'd somehow runaway. That's still a possibility, so be aware of your surroundings and where you're letting your dog run. I personally do not let my huskies off leash in open areas because I didn't train them that way. I live near a dog park that's completely enclosed and gives them the opportunity to burn all their energy. They have so much fun and it's nice for them to be able to explore. Huskies are highly energetic and need to take out their energy on something or else you'll run into trouble at home.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I hope these are helpful but don't forget to do some more research! You can always ask me more question too! Just <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> and we can talk about some of my experiences parenting a husky and any other tips I can think of. I'd love to hear from you if you decide on getting one or if you're a sibe parent yourself!</p>
